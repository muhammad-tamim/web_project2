# Project Description:
This is a simple web development project created using basic HTML and CSS. The primary goal of this project was to apply the fundamental concepts and skills I had learned over the past couple of weeks.

## Note:
The website is not responsive. My display resolution is 1280 x 720 (HD) pixels, so I designed this webpage based on my screen. For the best viewing experience, please resize your browser window to match this resolution.
