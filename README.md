## Project Name: Portfolio
## Project Description:
This is a simple web development project created using HTML and CSS, with a focus on learning and applying Flexbox. The primary objective of this project was to implement the fundamental concepts and techniques I have studied over the past few weeks.

## Note:
The website is not responsive. My display resolution is 1280 x 720 (HD) pixels, so I designed this webpage based on my screen. For the best viewing experience, please resize your browser window to match this resolution.

## What I newly learned while building this project:
GitHub Live Pages does not support absolute file paths.

✅ Use: images/hardy.png or ../images/developer.png

❌ Avoid: /images/hardy.png or /images/developer.png


Thank you for checking out my project!😊 I am continuously learning and improving myself, so your feedback and suggestions would mean a lot to me.
